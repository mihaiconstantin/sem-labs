These exercises are also discussed in the pdf from Kline, so check that for more details.

1) Note that error and factor variances are not drawn but still need to be counted.\
Models a, b, c, d have df = 0\
Model e has df = 4 and model f has df = 3.\
2) Model a is identified.\'a0\
Model b is not identified because no subset of three indicators exist whose errors are uncorrelated with one another.\
Model c is identified.\
Model d is not-identified because factor B does not have two indicators whose errors are uncorrelated with one another.\
Model e is identified because the errors terms of the two indicators of factor A (same hold for the error terms of the indicators of factor B) are 
\f0\b both 
\f1\b0 uncorrelated with the error term of indicator X4 (and of X5) of factor C (rule D1). If factor C was dropped from this model, it would be not-identified. Rule D2 also holds for factors A and B, because, e.g., the error term of X1 is not correlated with the error term of X4.\
Model f is identified.}
