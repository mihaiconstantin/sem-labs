# Lab Description

In this assignment you will learn how to fit *Structural Equation Models* (SEM)
while accounting for *Common Method Bias*. For this practical you will need the
following packages: `lavaan`, `semPlot`, and `haven`. You can install and load
these packages using the following code:

```{r size="footnotesize", eval=FALSE}
# Install packages.
install.packages(c("lavaan", "semPlot", "haven"))

# Load the packages.
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)
library(haven)
```

Please note that the data for following assignment are kindly provided by [dr.
Pieter de Rooij](https://pure.buas.nl/en/persons/pieter-de-rooij) from *Breda
University of Applied Sciences*. We acquired permission to use the data in the
course *Research Master: Structural Equation Modeling and Analysis of
Longitudinal Data*. Should you want to use the data outside the scope of this
course, please make sure to obtain written approval from dr. Pieter de Rooij (at

## More about the data

This dataset contains $27$ items that seek to measure $9$ dimensions (i.e.,
constructs) of visitorsâ€™ experiences when they attend a performance in the
performing arts sector (e.g., drama, dance, musical, stand up comedy, opera,
classical music). Each construct is indicated by $3$ items as shown in *Table
1*. Scales were rated on $5$ point *Likert* scales (i.e. from $1 = \text{totally
disagree}$ to $5 = \text{totally agree}$).

Start by loading the *SPSS* dataset `data.sav` into `R` using the `haven`
package.

- *Hint.* Check out the `read_spss` function from the `R` package `haven`.

## Questions

1. Estimate a *CFA* model for the $9$ constructs. Evaluate the fit of this
   model.

2. Estimate a *CFA* model for the $9$ constructs together with a *method factor*
   to control for potential *common method bias*. Model the *common method
   variance* with a single *latent method variable*. Implement equality
   constraints on the loadings of the method factor and also implement the
   necessary constraints for the associations between method and content
   factors.

3. Test both models against each other using the *Likelihood Ratio Test* (LRT).
   What do you conclude?

4. Do you see other possibilities to improve the fit of the model?
